                            As a legal worker you are in a very specialized field and should be able to look in one
                            place for job opportunities. You
                            are limited to search in large pools that can become overwhelming, or worth with recruiting
                            agencies that only work with
                            clients that pay them money to bring in new hires.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            As a law firm it is very hard to find qualified legal workers and deal with the hiring
                            process all while maintaining the
                            firm. Finding the help you want shouldn’t be that hard, but also shouldn’t be so
                            economically draining. Many firms
                            complain about the process of finding new help and also the quality of that help in compared
                            to the money it costs.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our goal is to eliminate the problems from both ends. We give legal workers more options
                            when looking for a new job, and
                            we give law firms a more economical and streamlined approach to find better fitting
                            candidates.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            At Legal Connect we take advantage of technology and blend it with the perfect amount of
                            human input to eliminate the
                            waste in the industry but still give high quality service.

                            <p><strong>How It Works for Law Firms</strong></p>
                            If you are a business that hires legal workers such as lawyers, paralegals, or legal
                            secretaries, you can register for
                            our website or contact us for free concierge set up. We have two models that firms can sign
                            up for. The most popular
                            model is where you sign up for a one year membership and post your jobs to our website.
                            During the first three months we
                            have a complimentary on boarding process where we can assist you with setting up your
                            account, posting jobs, and
                            managing your account by notifying you when new hires come in. You may continue that process
                            for a small fee to your
                            membership after the three months. We market our website and our jobs to lawyers through
                            direct marketing in the area,
                            local publications, trade shows, online, and other areas that bring full exposure to all of
                            our jobs.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The other option is an ala cart service where the membership is complimentary but there is a
                            fee per hire. This is the
                            more standard approach, however we understand some firms will still prefer this method. If
                            this is your preference,
                            please contact us to register as these programs are tailored to firm size and needs.

                            website. Find a job you are interested in and hit apply. After that simply wait for the

                            you need our assistance at any time just contact us by email, telephone, or text. All jobs
                            are full time positions which
                            means you will work directly for the employer and have no additional connection with Legal
